- I've always been a little obsessed with hearing every word in the english language spoken at the same time. In fact I'm pretty interested in the entire idea of information comming at you so fast that it's incomprehensible. Someday, I'd like to put together an entire art show of things that examine this topic - for example, 
  - a program that layers every instagram picture taken that day on top of the other (very opaquely) and, at the end     of the day, it prints the single picture out on a large canvas. 
  - a program that continuously prints out wikipedia edits in real time (perferrably on a printer circa 1980)
  - a large digital display that simply counts up the number of facebook 'likes' for the day
  - a program that tries to compile all the code pushed to github for the day (which would obviously fail)
  - AND FINALY a program that reads out the tweets, on the top five trending topics, in different languages, in real      time. 
    - although most of these ideas are beyong my ability right now, I figure I could maybe create a small program          that reads tweets outloud, in english, one at a time.  So, that's what I am going to try to do.
